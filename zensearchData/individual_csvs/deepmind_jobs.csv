The role
We are seeking a highly motivated and talented Research Scientist to join our team at the forefront of multimodal large language model (LLM) research. You will work alongside a world-class team of researchers and engineers to develop and advance the next generation of AI models that can seamlessly integrate and reason across different modalities such as text, images, audio, and video.
Key responsibilities

Develop and implement next-generation agentic reasoning frameworks for multimodal understanding: This core responsibility involves moving beyond single-step inference to design models that can formulate complex plans, critique their own thought processes, and iteratively refine their conclusions. You will explore reinforcement learning (RL) to reward detailed reasoning chains, develop robust self-critique mechanisms for error correction, and integrate tool-use, enabling models to execute code for interactive video analysis and manipulation. Your work will directly address the project's goal of teaching models to solve problems that require deep, contextual reasoning over extended periods.
Pioneer the extension of visual reasoning from 2D into the 3D domain, enabling a more physically-grounded form of intelligence: Your research will focus on empowering models like Gemini to not just perceive 2D images and videos, but to infer and construct coherent 3D representations of the world from them. You will then leverage this deep spatial understanding to develop novel generative capabilities, such as synthesizing photorealistic views of a scene from new perspectives or allowing for the interactive modification of 3D objects and layouts. This frontier research is crucial for unlocking future applications in robotics, mixed reality, and creating agents that can truly reason about and interact with their physical environment.
Spearhead the creation of novel, challenging benchmarks to rigorously measure progress and define the future of visual reasoning: As models become more capable, existing benchmarks become insufficient. You will be responsible for identifying these gaps and leading the development of the next wave of evaluation datasets that test the limits of multimodal intelligence.
