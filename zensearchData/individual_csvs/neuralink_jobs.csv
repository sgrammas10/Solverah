Our team spans a wide range of disciplines, from neuroscience and machine learning to software engineering and interface design.
Job Description:
Were looking for a design engineering intern to conceptualize, prototype, and ship novel computing interfaces tailored for BCI. Our ideal candidate will possess the following qualities:

Passion to explore an open-ended, multi-disciplinary, constrained space where design choices are informed by neural structure, model architecture, radio bandwidth, and more. For instance, a slight difference in an animated spring coefficient can change perceptual response time, shifting the alignment of labels and the performance of our decoders. You will actively collaborate with domain experts within and outside the team to understand these constraints and design your way around them
An intuitive sense for what level of fidelity to reach for when navigating this space, be it a conversation, a rough sketch, or a testable prototype
Excitement to work within and push the boundaries of an entirely new medium of interaction without the traditional sensory feedback of existing physical input devices (e.g., the kinetic friction of glass along the surface of a trackpad, or the resistive pressure of a spring during a keypress)
The ability to empathize with and design for people with a sensory experience that differs from your own, and ambition to build something that feels magical, beyond the local minima of that which works. Youll do whatever it might take to deliver that experience, be it a highly optimized vertex shader or a custom property animator, while maintaining an extremely high bar for fluidity and detail throughout
A strong point-of-view, without egoyou may occasionally pursue a hunch that not everyone on the team agrees with, but are relentless about testing, deleting, and learning from ideas that dont work
