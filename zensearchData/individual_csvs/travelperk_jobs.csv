Value


Attribute

You can sustain delivery in a hyper-speed working environment while maintaining your own satisfaction and wellbeing.

We are a team


 


 




Collaboration


You encourage innovation within team work, and you like to challenge the status quo amongst your working group. You work to understand  the needs and expectations of progressive in-house teams customers.

 



Honesty


You share your failures with your team. You do this to humanise failure, and to coach and increase awareness.  You communicate transparently - up, down and across - and form relationships that emphasise being direct with people in your workplace.

 



Communication


You enter conversations with a flexible and open mind. You're open to listening to and understanding other people's point of view, rather than simply getting your message across.

 



Impact over Effort


 


 




Prioritisation


You regularly review your workload/ manage up in order to concentrate your efforts on the most impactful matters for TravelPerk and TravelPerk mission and vision; you're realistic and don't over promise.

Where will the role take you?
We believe passionately in the importance of growth and development for lawyers; and that every lawyer is entitled to a job from which they derive high levels of personal satisfaction. Talented and driven people are entitled to expect employers to offer an employee value proposition which offers continual levelling up.  
A successful occupant of this role will, after a suitable period of time, have exceptional experience of working in a fast scaling, global tech (and specifically SaaS) business. He or she will develop the tools and techniques to deliver internal privacy capability at scale which subverts the expectations of stakeholders regarding privacy and AI governance laws (i.e. that it is bureaucracy) and drives tangible business outcomes.  
In terms of promotions, the next layer up from Junior Privacy &amp; AI Counsel is Privacy &amp; AI Counsel. We are not hiring in this layer currently, and do not expect to hire over the head of this role; instead, we are looking for this person to grow and scale capability in their areas of expertise (and among legal subject matter experts who interact with other legal and privacy roles). TravelPerk will offer you as much latitude as you want in order to deliver the best possible outcomes for your customers; and micromanagement or layers of bureaucracy are not part of that process.
The winning candidate will benefit from a competitive salary, stock options and a positive, high impact not long hours culture.

Hear more about TravelPerk.  
The Opportunity
TravelPerk is on a mission to redefine how companies manage travel and expense. But more than that, were creating a category that helps businesses eliminate the broken processes, and the complexity thats been accepted as normal for far too long.
We believe the future of work isnt just about productivity tools. Its about freedom. Clarity. Simplicity. And real work. That belief drives everything we do, from our product design to our brand expression. And now, were looking for a bold brand leader to help bring it to life at scale.
This is more than a brand role. Its a chance to lead the creation of a category, and build a global brand with the stature, swagger, and soul of a consumer icon, while driving growth in one of the most dynamic B2B markets out there.
Reporting to the VP of Marketing, youll:


Shape how the world sees TravelPerk


Define how we show up and embed brand thinking into every touchpoint (internally and externally)


Lead the largest brand awareness investment weve ever made


Lead an incredible group of senior leaders across brand, content, campaigns, and creative


Push boundaries, take risks, and make work that makes people feel something


Set the vision, drive operational excellence, and hold full accountability for the brand marketing budget, performance, and outcomes


Operate at the intersection of creativity, commercial impact, and executional rigour, scaling a brand thats not just known, but loved


 
Who You Are
Youre a B2B marketer with a B2C soul, who has a deep understanding of the US market. You know how to build trust with business leaders, but you dont believe business needs to be boring.


Youve led brands at fast-growing companies or worked agency-side with some of the worlds most ambitious brands


You bring creative stretch and operational discipline to every brief, and you know how to invest in brand at scale


Youve owned multi-million-dollar brand budgets, not just spent them, but strategically allocated them across channels, markets, and moments


Youre obsessed with performance, measuring brand impact, optimising investments, and proving value to the boardroom


Youve built brands for the US market, and you understand the nuance, tone, pace, and channels that work in this landscape


Youve activated partnerships, sponsorships, and influencer programmes that shape culture and drive attention


Youve led brand efforts where the ambition matched the scale: new category, global market, high-stakes growth


You thrive in global businesses, balancing consistency with local insight and building cross-functional alignment across regions and time zones


 
Why This Role, Why Now
Were at a pivotal point in our journey. The product is strong, the category is clear, and the appetite to build a standout brand is real across the entire exec team. Weve got the momentum. Weve got the investment. Now we need someone who can lead with vision, operate with discipline, and drive results.
This isnt a role for someone who wants to optimise what exists. Its for someone who wants to create what doesnt. Youve scaled brands globally, led large teams, managed eight-figure budgets, and made brand a board-level growth lever.
Now youre ready to do it again. Only bolder.
 
What Youll Bring


15+ years of experience in brand marketing, ideally with a blend of B2B and B2C


Deep experience building brands for US markets (required)


Comfortable owning and optimising large-scale brand budgets


Experience in brand measurement, reporting, and brand-health tracking


Experience working in or with creative agencies is a plus


Comfortable operating across time zones (our core team is Europe-based)


 
This is your chance to build something iconic. To break the mould. To leave your fingerprints on a brand that challenges convention and lights a fire under an entire industry.
This is a senior leadership role, not for someone whos run a few brand campaigns, but for a brand architect who has scaled a company, built global teams, and made brand a boardroom conversation.

About the role
At TravelPerk, weve always believed business travel could be better: easier, faster, more human. So we built a category-leading platform to prove it.
Now were raising the bar again.
Marketplace is the engine behind TravelPerk. With over $200 million in annual revenue, it powers every booking, every traveller, and every partner integration  from flights and hotels to rail, car hire, inventory systems, APIs, and post-booking automation. But its more than infrastructure. Marketplace is how we deliver flexibility, choice, and innovation to customers at scale. Its central to our growth and the foundation for everything were building next.
To lead this chapter, were hiring a Vice President of Product, Marketplace. Reporting to our new CPO, youll own the strategy, execution, and team across our entire travel stack. This isnt a greenfield build. Its a mature, high-scale platform that already works. Now it needs to move faster, operate more efficiently, and meet a new level of reliability and performance.
This is a builders role, but not in the traditional sense. You wont be starting from zero. Youll be scaling a complex product to new levels of maturity, automation, and trust. Youll raise the bar for technical quality, team execution, and customer experience. And youll do it all with clarity, intensity, and deep product leadership.
 
Why this role matters
TravelPerk now operates two core business units:


Marketplace (Travel): a $200 million ARR platform powering millions of trips and billions in transactions


Spend &amp; Control (Expenses, Invoicing, Approvals): a fast-growing $100 million ARR business with major product expansion underway


As VP of Product  Marketplace, youll lead the entire travel domain: supply integrations, vertical product experiences (flights, hotels, rail, car rental), post-booking flows, APIs, automation layers, and our growing ecosystem of third-party partner integrations.
Marketplace is not just a feature. It is the foundation. It powers our scale and supports the experiences customers rely on every day. This role is critical to TravelPerks growth, operational stability, and strategic positioning.
 
What youll do


Own and evolve the Marketplace product vision, roadmap, and team


Lead a cross-functional organisation of around 60 across product, design, and research, partnering closely with over 200 engineers


Manage a high-scale, mature product suite across flights, hotels, rail, and car rental


Increase system speed, scalability, and platform reliability to support continued growth


Scale our inventory connectivity across NDC, GDS, and direct integrations


Drive automation across post-booking experiences and operational workflows


Expand our integrations Marketplace, enabling customers to connect HR, payments, expense, and sustainability tools into their travel workflows


Partner closely with Engineering and Supply to deliver high-impact technical and commercial improvements


Build and lead high-performing teams with clear goals, strong ownership, and consistent delivery


 
What were looking for


10+ years in senior product leadership roles (Director/VP level), ideally in travel tech or high-scale marketplace platforms


Strong technical fluency, especially across transactional systems, APIs, and automation


A track record of leading large product organisations (30+ in product/design, 100+ in engineering)


Comfort operating in complex, high-volume environments with operational pressure and scale


Proven ability to raise the bar across uneven teams and drive strong execution quickly


Experience scaling platform layers, connectivity, or partner ecosystems


A clear, confident communicator who brings focus, energy, and urgency to the team


 
Why now? Why you?
Marketplace is already a $200 million business. But it is nowhere near done.
There is a team in place. There is volume. There is demand. What we need now is leadership. Someone who can turn Marketplace into a world-class product organisation  reliable, focused, and high-performing.
This is a rare opportunity to lead one of the most strategic areas of our product at true scale, with full executive backing and visibility. Youll work with smart, ambitious people. Youll take on tough technical and operational challenges. And youll help shape the future of business travel, every day.

 Exponential growth opportunitiesHow We WorkOur Vision is for a world where TravelPerk is the platform for human connection in real life (IRL). We take an IRL-first approach to work, where our team works together in person 3 days a week. For roles in Customer Care, this can be up to 5 days per week in the office. As such, this role requires you to be within commuting distance of our hubs. We fundamentally believe in meeting in real life to improve connectivity, productivity, and creativity, ultimately making us a great workplace.
At TravelPerk, we prioritise experience and potential over academic qualifications for this role. Talent and ability aren't always reflected in formal credentials.
TravelPerk is a global company with a diverse customer base, and we want to ensure that the people behind our product reflect that. We're an equal opportunity employer, meaning you're welcome at TravelPerk regardless of your appearance, where you're from, or anything else that makes you.
Protect Yourself from Recruitment ScamsAll official communication from TravelPerk will always come from email addresses ending in @travelperk.com, our verified social media channels, or recruiters listed on our official LinkedIn page. We will never ask you to pay for equipment, training, or fees, request sensitive personal information such as bank details early in the process, or communicate through unofficial apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal. If you receive a message claiming to be from TravelPerk that seems suspicious, please do not respond. Forward it to security@travelperk.com and well confirm whether its legitimate."
