In 2009, Riot released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As the most played video game in the world, over 100 million play every month. Players form the foundation of our community and its for them that we continue to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience.
Were looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play seriously; youre passionate about games. We embrace those who see things differently, arent afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
That's where you come in.
As a Game Product Manager on the FFGS team, you will be responsible for FFGS set development. You will partner with cross-functional teams and work closely with the product and design lead to align on set/modes goals, ensure a strong player-focused strategy is in place for each set, and set a course to achieve those goals. Your role will be to follow TFT set strategy, drive FFGS set development, establish a roadmap,  and contribute to the overall FFGS gameplay strategy. Youll also ensure that the collaboration team with our development partner on set development is working healthily and effectively, while collaborating with publishing and other partners to ensure alignment towards set goals.
As a Rioter in China, you'll join a team of internationally and culturally diverse professionals that share our prioritization of player experience, rejection of convention and maniacal passion for gaming. 
To reinforce Riots collaborative culture in our China offices, weve decided to do away with the constraints of traditional hierarchical title structures that are more common in the region. Titles dont really matter at any of Riots offices, but we chose to take this extra step in our China offices to foster a space where teamwork thrives. We believe that removing this constraint will promote individual autonomy, ownership, collaboration, and a focus on results. We promise you wont need a title at Riot to make an impact.
Responsibilities:

Drive and execute on planning and multi-phase roadmap for FFGS set and mode development, ensuring alignment with TFTs broader product goals and long-term objectives.
Influence cross-functional teams to ensure consistent, high-quality player experiences and foster alignment across product, design, insights, and technical teams toward common goals.
Drive engagement following success metrics that not only drive project success of each set/mode, but provide insights that influence team-wide strategic decisions. 
Drive day to day meeting and follow-ups on set related features, patch updates and balance discussions with designers to ensure micro changes are made to improve overall FFGS players set experience
Identify cross-functional opportunities for growth and innovation within revival sets, pushing the game forward in alignment with Riots and TFTs broader strategy, establishing FFGS as a pioneering product within the genre.
Work with the team and stakeholders to set measurable goals and translate them into product requirements that guide design and technical specifications.
Monitor overall game health and performance of player engagement, regularly updating stakeholders on progress and be solution oriented when needed.
Drive a culture of end-to-end ownership, ensuring that each set is delivered with accountability from concept through execution and is aligned with strategic goals.

Required Qualifications:

35 years of experience (or a PhD) in product management across games, live operations, and system/feature design, with a proven record of driving strategic impact and influence.
Passion and deep familiarity with Teamfight Tactics / FFGS and strategy games, with proven experience applying player-centric insights to drive product innovation.
Experience shipping products with cross-discipline teams, demonstrating the ability to work in fast-paced, dynamic environments.
Outstanding verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to partner across multiple disciplines.
Bilingual in both English and Mandarin

Desired Qualifications:

Understanding of growth, retention, and mobile gaming strategies to create player value.
Ability to analyze large data sets to identify actionable insights that guide decision-making.
Strong analytical skills with experience in competitive analysis, using industry insights to inform product strategy and ensure FFGSs market position remains strong.

For this role, you'll find success through craft expertise, a collaborative spirit, and decision-making that prioritizes the delight of players. We will be looking at your past studies, experience, and your personal relationship with games. If you embody player empathy and care about players' experiences, this could be your role!
Dont forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of applications, but well notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take play seriously."
