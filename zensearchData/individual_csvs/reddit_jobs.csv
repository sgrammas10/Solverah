The Infrastructure organization has the mission of building and delivering common software, frameworks, and constructs for the rest of Reddit.  Reddit has a complex production serving environment consisting of AWS, GCP and running several compute clusters (Kubernetes) across both.  
Within Infrastructure Foundations, we are looking to expand our engineering management in Compute Platform / Infrastructure: Part software engineering (SWE) this groups responsibility spans from the Linux kernel up to our Kubernetes autoscalers and multi-cluster orchestration/federation. Developing the platform that runs Reddit requires balancing developer experience, reliability, and safety in supporting one of the worlds largest websites.
Our teams are building and maintaining the complex software needed to rapidly grow and sustain Reddit's cloud compute production environment. Having experience managing high-performance software engineering teams is important for success in this role.  Previous experience with distributed systems at web scale (thousands of nodes, hundreds of systems) is a plus.  
This is a high impact role where your positive contributions will be amplified through the Reddit technology stack and lead to direct business impact.

Lead: Work with the team to select, scope, and drive high leverage projects that align with Reddits goals to scale our infrastructure to a large multiple of what it is today by abstracting away the technical details of our compute infrastructure by building a developer-facing platform.
Build: Hire, onboard, and build out your team to execute on a strategy and create a more efficient, scalable, and user friendly compute platform.
Amplify: Mentor your ICs and be a leader for the team.
Collaborate: Work together with a variety of teams across Reddit Engineering.
Evolve: Learn and improve your own technical and non-technical abilities.

What were looking for

2-4 years experience in people management of high performing platform or infrastructure engineering teams, including setting clear goals, driving execution, developing product roadmaps, and supporting career growth. 
5+ years experience on cloud infrastructure and compute platforms.

This experience should include ample time developing and shipping software.

Strong technical judgment and ability to evaluate the quality of engineering decisions related to cloud infrastructure systems (Kubernetes, AWS, GCE). Accountability for the team's technical output and operational decisions.
Strong focus on scalability, performance, user experience, and quality. You are an undying advocate for the user, and you have a deep intuition for how critical infra systems work at scale and how to improve user experience through platforms.
High empathy, excellent communication skills, and the ability to find compromise working across the entire engineering org.
Experience in Go, Kubernetes, Argo, Flux, and other CNCF landscape projects is a huge plus.
