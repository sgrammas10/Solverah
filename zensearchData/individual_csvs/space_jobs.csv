Joining Relativity means becoming part of something where autonomy, ownership, and impact exist at every level. Here, you're not just executing tasks; you're solving problems that havent been solved before, helping develop a rocket, a factory, and a business from the ground up. Whether youre in propulsion, manufacturing, software, avionics, or a corporate function, youll collaborate across teams, shape decisions, and see your work come to life in record time. Relativity is a place where creativity and technical rigor go hand in hand, and your voice will help define the stories were writing together. Now is a unique moment in time where its early enough to leave your mark on the product, the process, and the culture, but far enough along that Terran R is tangible and picking up momentum. The most meaningful work of your career is waiting. Join us.About the Team: 
The Quality team is focused on embedding quality into every part of the design and production process for Terran R. Not just inspecting at the end but influencing how things are built from the start. The team embeds themselves directly within design, manufacturing, test, and launch teams to stay close to the hardware, understand constraints, and proactively shape decisions. As we move beyond initial development into production and then scaled operations, now is the time to put the right processes, controls, and inspections in place without slowing down progress. The team plays a key role in balancing risk, driving a culture of ownership, and ensuring that speed doesnt come at the cost of reliability. Success here means building a quality system that scales with the Terran R program and Relativity as a whole.
About the Role:

Serve as the technical point of contact for rocket parts and assemblies, resolving manufacturing and quality issues to protect production schedules.
Lead new product introduction by selecting manufacturing methods, identifying suppliers, and developing scalable processes.
Conduct design for manufacturing (DFM) reviews and apply APQP principles to ensure efficient, high-quality production from early development stages. Leverage experience with Production Part Approval Process (PPAP), First Article Inspection Reports (FAIRs), and 8D problem solving.
Manage supplier sourcing and evaluations, issue corrective actions, and ensure compliance with AS9100, ISO 9001, and NASA quality standards.
Create and develop specifications to communicate quality and manufacturing requirements across the supply base.
Analyze defect data, lead root cause investigations (e.g., 8D, PPAP, FAIR), and implement corrective actions to improve supplier performance.

About You:

You have 8+ years of experience in supplier quality or supplier development engineering, with in-depth knowledge of industry standards like AS9100, ISO 9001, and NASA quality standards and ERP/MRP system experience.
You have a strong technical and experiential knowledge of manufacturing processes for space-quality hardware, including forming, cutting, machining, and assembly of various metals like stainless and carbon steels.
You have experience with supplier quality processes such as Production Part Approval Process (PPAP), Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP), and First Article Inspection Reports (FAIRs) with a disciplined approach to problem solving, such as 8D methodology.
You have experience with New Product Development and PPAP implementation.
You are a self-starter who can define and own a process from scratch and roll it out to a diverse team, with willingness to travel up to 50% of the work week when needed.

Nice to haves but not required:  

Familiarity with high-volume inspection methods and data-driven acceptance methods
Strong knowledge of enterprise applications (i.e., PLM, ERP, MES) and proficient in data analysis

The Structures and Mechanisms team is responsible for the full design, build, and test lifecycle of Terran Rs integrated structures and flight mechanisms. Whether you're working on highly iterative mechanisms that move or tight-margin structures that shouldnt, youll get hands-on hardware ownership and see the rocket coming to life on the factory floor. Both teams fall under one department, sharing design principles, tools, and an integrated approach that provides a comprehensive view of Terran R. Team members work on multiple parts, not just within a single subsystem, and are empowered to make decisions that directly impact flight hardware. Beyond first flight, youll play a critical role in refining for manufacturability and speed.
About the Role: 
The scope of work encompasses a full design cycle, including conceptualization, design, analysis, manufacturing and testing for primary and secondary structures related to Thrust Structure, Propellant Tanks, Interstage or Fairing, to name a few. You will need to think creatively and leverage innovation to reduce mass, parts, processes and tooling required.
Your responsibilities will include, but not be limited to the following:

Innovative conceptualization of structural load path, design for complex structures and adjacent system packaging.
Review of static &amp; dynamic load inputs, material properties &amp; test as well as structural systems &amp; subsystems requirements.
Analysis and sizing of flight structures to ensure timely design reviews and drawing release.
Develop and support hardware test campaigns, including test integration, operation and result evaluation.
Support manufacturing process development.

In order to be successful in this role, you must be someone who is self-motivated, adaptable and is able to lead your own projects to completion in a fast-paced environment. Ideally, you have significant mechanical or structural design experience and a proven track record completing collaborative projects effectively.
On a weekly basis, you will be designing flight components for our upcoming Terran R vehicle using NX/TeamCenter, performing analysis using Nastran, ANSYS and/or hand calculations, creating and releasing drawings as well as supporting fabrication of your components. You will own your design from requirements to production. You will also use your strong organizational skills to properly document your work and present your recommendations when decisions are needed.
About You:  

8+ years of experience in a design engineering role.
Bachelors degree in engineering or related technical discipline
Significant experience with industry-standard CAD packages such as NX, Creo, or Solidworks
Working knowledge of structural analysis (hand calculation, Finite Elements Methods and industry tools) and test
Fundamental knowledge of structures strength, stability and fatigue failure mechanisms.
Fundamental knowledge of additive and traditional manufacturing processes
Full life cycle project ownership experience

Nice to haves but not required:  

8+ years of mechanical or structural design &amp; analysis experience.
Extensive experience with NX/TeamCenter.
Expertise using Nastran and ANSYS.
Experience with GD&amp;T and drafting.
