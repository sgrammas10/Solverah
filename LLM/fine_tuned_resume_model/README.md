# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'Summary: Hardware professional with 6 years of hands-on experience. Skills: I2C, UART, C/C++, BLE, RTOS. Education: BA in Marketing. Continuously learning and staying current with industry best practices. Documented processes and mentored junior colleagues.',
    'Clinical Coordinator Responsibilities: Use data to drive decisions and measure impact. Requirements: experience with Patient Education, HIPAA, Vitals, BLS, Epic, EHR. Strong communication and customer-centric mindset required. Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment.',
    'Instructional Coach Responsibilities: Use data to drive decisions and measure impact. Requirements: experience with Classroom Management, Assessment, Lesson Planning, IEP, Google Classroom. Strong communication and customer-centric mindset required. Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment.',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[ 1.0000, -0.0050, -0.0049],
#         [-0.0050,  1.0000, -0.0050],
#         [-0.0049, -0.0050,  1.0000]])
