# SentenceTransformer based on sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) model finetuned from [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2). It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and can be used for semantic textual similarity, semantic search, paraphrase mining, text classification, clustering, and more.

## Model Details

- **Maximum Sequence Length:** 256 tokens
- **Output Dimensionality:** 384 dimensions
- **Similarity Function:** Cosine Similarity
<!-- - **Training Dataset:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **Language:** Unknown -->
<!-- - **License:** Unknown -->

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("sentence_transformers_model_id")
# Run inference
sentences = [
    'Software Backend Engineer\nSummary: Professional with hands-on experience across the domain.\nSkills: c++, cloud, docker, java, linux, microservices, python, rest, sql.\nHighlights: Delivered projects end-to-end; worked cross-functionally; documented results. Demonstrated problem-solving and ownership.',
    'Backend Software Engineer\nResponsibilities: Contribute across the team and deliver high-quality outcomes.\nRequirements: experience with apis, c++, cloud, docker, java, microservices, python, sql. Strong collaboration and communication.',
    'Frontend Engineer (React)\nResponsibilities: Contribute across the team and deliver high-quality outcomes.\nRequirements: experience with accessibility, css, html, react, testing, typescript, ui. Passion for continuous learning.',
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 384]

# Get the similarity scores for the embeddings
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.8173, 0.5277],
#         [0.8173, 1.0000, 0.6495],
#         [0.5277, 0.6495, 1.0000]])
